For all 1D DP problems:
Step 1:
* Identify a dp problem: optimal is asked like count total no. of ways, min, max
* Whenever we are asked all possible ways: either count all ways or return best way, we can use recursion and then use DP

Step2. To solve the problem after identification.
   1. Try to represent the given problem in terms of index(in case of array and even when no array is there).
   2. Do all possible operations on that index according to the problem statement.
   3. If ques says:
   		-To count all possible ways, then do sum of all stuff.
        - To find minimum/maximum, then take Minimum/maximum of all stuff.
