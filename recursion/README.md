## Recursion

* The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function
* Here bigger problem is solved by solving smaller subproblems.

* As we have heard in recursive functions input is made smaller i.e If N was give to function then in the second iteration the problem is reduced to small instances of (N-1). So basically our aim is not to make input smaller, it is just consequence of decisions taken by us.
* To identify whether a problem is recursive problem or not.
	- We will be given some choices then we have to take some decisions.


### Methods to solve recurion problem:

* Base-Induction-Hypothesis
	* Base condtion - it is smallest valid input or smallest invalid input
* Recursive Tree
* Choice Diagram
